# HEART DISEASES PREDICITION
# PROBLEM DEFINITION
The major challenge in heart disease is its detection. There are
instruments available which can predict heart disease but either they are
expensive or not efficient to calculate the chance of heart disease in
humans. Early detection of cardiac diseases can decrease the mortality
rate and overall complications. However, it is not possible to monitor
patients every day in all cases accurately and consultation of a patient
for 24 hours by a doctor is not available since it requires more sapience,
time, and expertise. Since we have a good amount of data in todayâ€™s
world, we can use various machine learning algorithms to analyze the
data for hidden patterns. The hidden patterns can be used for health
diagnosis in medical data.
